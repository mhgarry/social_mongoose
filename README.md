## Description

1. Application description: Social Mongoose is a social media backend with full crud operations created with a nosql database, specifically mongodb.
2. I built this app I wanted to build a nosql scalable and functional social media backend for future web development projects.
3. This app It gives myself and other developers a social media backend to work with that includes a mongodb nosql database with working models, routes, and controllers. This makes it easier for developers to focus on the front end and functionality of their applications because they know the backend is taken care of with this application.
